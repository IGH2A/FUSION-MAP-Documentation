# Project: FUSION-MAP((Framework for Unified Semantic Integration of ONtologies – Materials Acceleration Platform)

The FUSION-MAP (Framework for Unified Semantic Integration of ONtologies – Materials Acceleration Platform) project aims to accelerate the development and deployment of green hydrogen systems through the creation of multiple ontologies. These ontologies provide a comprehensive knowledge framework to address the diverse aspects of green hydrogen production, storage, distribution, and utilization. By facilitating seamless integration of information, the FUSION-MAP project aims to enhance collaboration, enable informed decision-making, and drive innovation in the field of green hydrogen. 

# Ongoing Implementation Efforts

There is currently an implementation effort working on creating the first version of a federated, publicly verifiable registry. Go to the Registry repository to learn more about the implementation details and project status.

# Getting Involved

This project is open-source, and our wish is for everyone interested to be part of the project and platform.

You are also welcome to fork it and use it for your own purposes, but we would hope you want to be a part of a common platform.



# Who Are We?

The project has been founded as a partnership including Hybrixcel, Inc., University of Windsor, and University of British Columbia.

In the registry repository, the Trusted Committer is currently @igh2a, who will represent the partnership and advocate for the partnerships' best interests.

In the origin-collaboration repositpory, the Trusted Committer is currently @igh2a, who is also responsible for setting up structures, guidelines and decision-making processes for the Project-FUSION-MAP Github organization. If you have any questions to anything, preferably post these in the Q&A in the discussion forum, and feel free to tag any of the Trusted Committers.
