# Ongoing Implementation Efforts

There is currently an implementation effort working on creating the first version of a federated, publicly verifiable registry. Go to the Registry repository to learn more about the implementation details and project status.

# Getting Involved

If you want to start collaborating with us, we are currently updating the Documentation to include guides on all the information you may need to start contributing to the project. If there is some information you would have liked that isn't there, we will recommend you to Create an Issue, where you can make a suggestion.

You can check out our discussion forums to see ongoing and previous discussions, to ask questions, or to make suggestions. Any discussions related to the currently ongoing implementation can be found at the Registry Discussion Channels. If you have any general suggestions or questions, you should go to the Organization Discussion Channels.

# Who Are We?

The project has been founded as a partnership including Hybrixcel, Inc., University of Windsor, and University of British Columbia.

In the registry repository, the Trusted Committer is currently @igh2a, who will represent the partnership and advocate for the partnerships' best interests.

In the origin-collaboration repositpory, the Trusted Committer is currently @igh2a, who is also responsible for setting up structures, guidelines and decision-making processes for the Project-FUSION-MAP Github organization. If you have any questions to anything, preferably post these in the Q&A in the discussion forum, and feel free to tag any of the Trusted Committers.

Talk based on FUSION-MAP-v1.0
